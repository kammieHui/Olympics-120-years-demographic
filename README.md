##üèÖ Olympic Data Analysis: Gender, Performance, and National Trends

üîç Project Overview

This project analyzes over 120 years of Olympic Games data to explore trends in athlete demographics, gender participation, and national dominance in medal-winning across disciplines. The analysis uses Python, SQL, and data visualization techniques to test several hypotheses around performance drivers and systemic trends.

‚∏ª

üìå Initial Hypotheses
	1.	Gender Shift: Female athlete participation has increased significantly in traditionally male-dominated sports post-2000.
	2.	Body Attributes & Success: Athletes with above-average height and weight are more likely to win medals in strength-based sports (e.g., weightlifting, rowing).
	3.	National Dominance: Wealthier or historically dominant Olympic nations (e.g., USA, China, Russia) consistently outperform smaller nations in overall medal counts.

üß≠ Analytical Approach

Data Exploration
	‚Ä¢	Track Olympic participation over time:
	‚Ä¢	Number of NOCs
	‚Ä¢	Number of events
	‚Ä¢	Number of athletes
	‚Ä¢	Visualize distributions of age, height, and weight via boxplots and histograms.
	‚Ä¢	Identify outliers and data irregularities.

Hypothesis Testing
	‚Ä¢	Gender Participation Trends:
	‚Ä¢	Stacked bar charts of male vs. female participation per year.
	‚Ä¢	Identify sports with the most growth in female representation (1996‚Äì2016) via SQL/Python.
	‚Ä¢	Logistic Regression Models:
	‚Ä¢	Assess if age, height, and weight significantly predict medal success.
	‚Ä¢	Run both overall and sport-specific analyses.
	‚Ä¢	Country-Sport Dominance:
	‚Ä¢	Use SQL and treemaps to explore which nations dominate in Athletics, Swimming, Rowing, Fencing, and Ice Hockey.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze medal progression trends (1988‚Äì2016).

üìà Key Findings

Gender Participation
	‚Ä¢	Steady Growth: Female athlete participation increased from near 0% in 1896 to nearly 45% in 2016.
	‚Ä¢	Leading Sports (1996‚Äì2016 growth):
	‚Ä¢	ü•á Cycling: +66.9%
	‚Ä¢	ü•à Synchronized Swimming: +63.9%
	‚Ä¢	ü•â Football: +63.7%

Physical Attributes vs. Medal Success
	‚Ä¢	Low Correlation: Age, height, and weight showed minimal predictive power for medal-winning.
	‚Ä¢	Sport-Specific Nuance: Slight advantages for taller/heavier athletes in power sports, but not universally significant.

National Trends
	‚Ä¢	USA Dominance:
	‚Ä¢	Swimming: Consistent leader; nearly 70 medals in 2016.
	‚Ä¢	Athletics: Fluctuations, but top rank held since 1988.
	‚Ä¢	Rising Nations:
	‚Ä¢	Great Britain in Rowing: Strong medal growth post-2000.
	‚Ä¢	Highly Competitive Disciplines:
	‚Ä¢	Ice Hockey: Ongoing Canada-USA rivalry since 2010.
	‚Ä¢	Fencing: No consistent leader‚ÄîItaly saw a decline post-2012.

üí° Insights & Implications
	‚Ä¢	Gender Equity: Strong evidence of progress in women‚Äôs participation. Policy and investment are paying off.
	‚Ä¢	Beyond Physical Metrics: Success is driven more by training, technique, and strategy than by age or physique alone.
	‚Ä¢	Strategic Investment Yields Results: Countries that back structured programs (e.g., GBR in rowing) see measurable performance gains.

üéØ Recommendations

For Olympic Committees:
	‚Ä¢	Sustain funding in historically strong disciplines (e.g., USA in swimming).
	‚Ä¢	For emerging nations: Invest in female-focused programs and underdog sports with high ROI potential.

For Researchers:
	‚Ä¢	Explore skill vs. physical-based predictors for medal outcomes.
	‚Ä¢	Analyze competitive density‚Äîdoes increased global participation correlate with more equitable medal distribution?

üìÇ Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢	Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
	‚Ä¢	SQL (PostgreSQL)
	‚Ä¢	Jupyter Notebooks
	‚Ä¢	Data Visualization (Treemaps, Line Charts, Stacked Bar Charts)
